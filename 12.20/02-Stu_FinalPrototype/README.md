# This Is Neat Bootstrap Prototype

In this activity, you are going to create a mobile first Bootstrap prototype using the wireframes you created in the first part of class using a combination of Bootstrap classes and custom media queries.

## Instructions

- Create the main content and review responsive grid first.

- Then, create the responsive jumbotron heading and button. The text heading should be replaced with the "Neat" logo at small and extra small sizes.

- Lastly, create a navigation bar that is removed at the extra small and small size.

## Hints

- A border radius of half of the height and width will create a circle.

- A border radius of half of the height will create semi-circles at the ends of an element.

- An square image can be made round by using the bootstrap class `rounded-circle`.

- You will need to use a combination of order and column width classes in your HTML.

- Use justify, align, and text alignment classes to properly place your elements.

- Use the [Bootstrap Documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/) and your Google-Fu skills!

## Bonus

- Center align all the text at extra small and small sizes.

### Emily B. Rose Bay (1 week ago)

Professional and arrived on time, booking process very easy. Received bond back in full as promised.

### Casey R. Leichhardt (2 months ago)

My online enquiries were answered almost instantly, the job was very easy to arrange online with a very user friendly website and flexible times for booking the clean, not to mention a great price! I shopped around and could not find a better price than This Is Neat. I was extremely happy with the quality of their work, my unit was cleaner than when I moved in! They were professional and friendly, very thorough and genuinely cared about doing a good job. I will definitely book This Is Neat’s services again and highly recommend them to my friends and family.

###Emily E. Greenwich (2 months ago)
This Is Neat Cleaning have fantastic customer service. It was so easy to book online and get a price instantly, and great to get a follow up call to confirm the details. Our real estate agent did dispute some elements of the cleaning, but This Is Neat were super responsive and immediately returned to re-clean those areas of the apartment - after which we got our full bond back. Would definitely recommend them!
